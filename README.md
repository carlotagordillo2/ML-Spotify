# Machine Learning Project

## Project Overview : Predicting Song Popularity Using Machine Learning

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting the popularity of a song based on various features, using data extracted from Spotify. We will leverage the Ultimate Spotify Tracks DB dataset sourced from Kaggle, which contains a wide range of song-related attributes such as tempo, duration, genre, and other musical characteristics. By using this data, the project aims to identify key factors that influence a song‚Äôs popularity on Spotify and create a model that can predict a song's popularity upon its release.


**Insights from our study**
Through this analysis, we identified some key factors that influence the popularity of a song on Spotify, such as tempo, genre, and duration. By analyzing these variables, we were able to discern patterns that contribute to a song's success.

- **Objective**:
  The primary objective of this project was to build a predictive model that can anticipate a song's popularity on Spotify based on its musical features. By doing so, we aim to offer insights into what makes a song more likely to become popular.
- **Focus Areas**: 
   - **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyzing and understanding the data to uncover patterns and trends.
   - **Machine Learning Models:** Applying different ML algorithms to predict the popularity of songs and determine which features have the most significant impact.





## Functionality ‚öôÔ∏è

- üßπ **Data Structure**: We have the following variables:
  - *Danceability:* Measure of how danceable the song is, based on rhythm, stability, beat strength and regularity (0 to 1).
  - *Energy:* Perceived level of intensity and activity of the song. High values represent fast and loud songs (0 to 1).
  - *Valence:* Emotional positivity of the song. High values indicate positivity (joy, euphoria), low values indicate sadness (0 to 1).
  - *Tempo:* Estimated tempo of the song in beats per minute (BPM).
  - *Intrumentalness:* Estimated tempo of the song in beats per minute (BPM).Predicts the amount of vocal elements in a song. Higher values indicate more instrumentals (0 to 1).
  - *Loudness:* Overall track volume in decibels (dB). Generally ranges from -60 to 0 dB.
  - *Popularity*: Measure of how popular the song is (0 to 100).
  - *Key:* Pitch of the song represented as an integer (0 = Do, 1 = Do#, ... 11 = Si).
  - *Mode:* Song mode: Major (1) or Minor (0).
  - *Speechiness:* Number of spoken words in the song. High values indicate spoken content (such as podcasts).
  - *Acoustiness:* Probability that the track is acoustic. Higher values indicate more acoustic content (0 to 1).
  - *Liveness:* The likelihood that the song was recorded live. Higher values indicate a more ‚Äòlive‚Äô environment (0 to 1).
  - *Duration_ms*: Song duration in milliseconds. 


## Tools Used üõ†Ô∏è

- üêç **Python**: Main programming language used for data processing and analysis.
- üêº **Pandas**: Library for data manipulation and analysis.
- üìä **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Libraries for data visualization.
- üìà **Power BI**: Tool for creating interactive dashboards and visualizing data insights.
- üìì **Jupyter Notebooks**: Interactive environment for data cleaning and visualization.
- ü§ñ **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library used for building and evaluating models.
- üåê **Git**: Version control system for tracking changes and collaboration.

## Development Process üöÄ

1. üßπ **Data Cleaning**:  
   The first step was to clean the dataset by handling missing values and removing duplicates. Outliers were **evaluated** but were **not removed** from the dataset, as they were not deemed problematic for the models in this context, ensuring that the data was in the best shape for modeling.

2. üîç **Data Visualization**:  
   We visualized the relationships between the variables to identify which ones had the most impact on the **popularity** column and to understand how different features influenced the target.

3. üíª **Machine Learning Models**:  
   - **Model Selection**: We tested different machine learning models to choose the best one for both the **classification** and **regression** tasks.
   - **Feature Selection**:
     - Chose relevant variables to train the models.
     - Dropped non-essential columns such as `['genre', 'artist_name', 'track_name', 'track_id', 'popularity']`.
   - **Popularity Classification**:
     - For the classification task, the **popularity** column was transformed into a categorical feature with five classes:
       - 'Very Low' (0-25)
       - 'Low' (25-50)
       - 'Medium' (50-75)
       - 'High' (75-90)
       - 'Top' (90-100)
   - **For Both Regression and Classification**:
     - **Train-Test Split**: Split the data into training and testing sets to ensure proper model evaluation.
     - **Data Normalization**: Applied normalization to scale the features and ensure the models were trained on properly scaled data.
     - **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Used PCA for dimensionality reduction to improve model efficiency by keeping only the most important features.
